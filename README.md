**SnafflerShieldX** is a powerful tool designed to analyze systems for sensitive files and generate detailed reports. It integrates with a modern graphical user interface (GUI) to ease interaction with the user. With a robust scanning engine and a parser to analyze results, **SnafflerShieldX** allows you to visualize security alerts efficiently and clearly.

## üì¶ Features

- **System Analysis**: Identifies sensitive files and generates reports.
- **Dynamic Exclusions**: Adds exclusions for removable drives and custom paths.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Intuitive interface built with PyQt6 for easy execution and result display.
- **Detailed Reports**: Generates CSV and JSON reports for detected alerts.
- **Result Visualization**: Displays an alert histogram by severity level and a pie chart for a clear distribution.

## üìä Graphical Features

- **Alert visualization by severity level** in a histogram.
- **Alert distribution** by severity level in a pie chart.
- **Directly open CSV reports** through a button in the interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before running **SnafflerShieldX**, make sure the following are installed on your machine:

- **Windows 10 or newer**.
- **Python 3.x** with `pip` installed.
- **WinRAR** installed to decompress files.
- **PowerShell** to execute automation scripts.

## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/SnafflerShieldX.git
      cd SnafflerShieldX
   ```

2. **Start the Setup**:
   ```bash
      Setup.ps1
   ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Run the program

1. Run the requirments .bat :

   ```bash
      requirments.bat
   ```
2.Run the GUI interface main.pyw
   ```bash
      python main.pyw
   ```

3. **Interface**:
   - Click on **"üöÄ Run Snaffler"** to start the scan.
   - View results in the text area.
   - You can display the histogram or open the generated CSV report.

### Main Features:

- **Background scanning**: The scan process runs in the background with real-time output displayed in the interface.
- **Error Handling**: If an error occurs during execution, the program will prompt the user to press **Enter** to resume the scan.
- **Report Display**: Once the scan is complete, you can view the results graphically or open the CSV file.

## üìë Example of Usage

Once the script is launched, you will see the detected machine name and the option to start the scan process. You can also view the reports as graphical charts (Histogram and Pie Chart).

- The process will scan the system and generate a report detailing security alerts.
- You can then view the histogram for the alert distribution by severity level.


## üîÑ Execution Process

1. The script checks for administrative rights to ensure it has the necessary privileges.
2. It adds exclusions for removable drives and the system disk.
3. It decompresses the `Packages.rar` file to extract the necessary executables.
4. It launches **Snaffler.exe** to perform the scan and generates a JSON file containing the detected alerts.
5. The JSON file is then processed by a PowerShell script to generate a CSV report.
6. The interface displays the results and allows you to open the CSV report or visualize the alerts in graphical form.
